# Forecasting Parking Meter Transactions in San Diego
Author: Stephen Reagin

Repository for a time series project fulfilling the requirements ADS 506: Applied Time Series Analysis

---

Hello, and thank you for visiting! The purpose of this repository is to provide data and analysis files in Python and R
that can forecast parking meter activity in the City of San Diego. You can read about the Motivation, Methods,
and Results in the [Final Report](https://github.com/sfreagin/parking_meters/blob/main/final_report/FinalReport.pdf)

Parking meter datasets in the [/datasets](https://github.com/sfreagin/parking_meters/tree/main/datasets) 
directory are originally sourced from the 
[City of San Diego Open Data Portal](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/parking-meters-transactions/)

Weather datasets are also in the [/datasets](https://github.com/sfreagin/parking_meters/tree/main/datasets) directory,
but you can also follow along the noaa_api.ipynb notebook file
in the [/notebooks](https://github.com/sfreagin/parking_meters/tree/main/notebooks) directory to pull 
your own weather data. The [/notebooks](https://github.com/sfreagin/parking_meters/tree/main/notebooks) directory 
also contains code for initial EDA, cleaning up the parking meter datasets and joining them to the weather data.

All time series modeling is done using R, and the code and markdown files are in the creatively-named
[/R_files](https://github.com/sfreagin/parking_meters/tree/main/R_files) directory
